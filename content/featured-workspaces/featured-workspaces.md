The featured workspaces of the AnvIL project demonstrate the discrete use cases of common genomic analysis pipelines that can be deployed using data and tools available on the AnVIL.

These use cases utilize unrestricted public data along with reproducible workflows, allowing researchers to clone and execute the workspaces as a learning exercise or for adapting to their own research.
